*NOTICE*
This my setup, my setup may not be the best one.

Hi,

A model file for VBar NEO FBL system written on EdgeTX2.9.4, Radiomaster Boxer.

I wanted to try the latest RC link, ExpressLRS, on my helicopter. So I tried it.

Today I would like to share my setup with you. I focused on implementing the radio setup as simple as possible while still implementing all the features of the VBar.

According to the claims of ExpressLRS developers, ExpressLRS has a communication method called FLRC mode with extremely low latency and high packet rate.

I think FLRC mode is good for the helicopters.

Of course, it may be difficult to actually feel the difference compared to other modern radios, like futaba, spektrum.
